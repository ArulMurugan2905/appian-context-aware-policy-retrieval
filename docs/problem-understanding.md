## Problem Understanding

Human agents working in Appian-based systems must follow strict policies and regulations while handling cases such as insurance claims, compliance reviews, and government processes.

Although relevant information exists, it is fragmented across hundreds of policy documents, SOPs, and regulatory PDFs.

The core challenge is not decision-making, but **quickly identifying the correct policy sections** applicable to the case being handled, without manual searching.
