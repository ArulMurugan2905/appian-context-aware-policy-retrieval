## Solution Overview

The proposed solution is a context-aware knowledge assistant embedded directly into the Appian case management workflow.

The system automatically reads the active case context (such as claim type and location) and retrieves the most relevant policy clauses from a pre-processed document repository.

This eliminates the need for keyword searches or switching between systems, while keeping the human agent in full control of the final decision.
