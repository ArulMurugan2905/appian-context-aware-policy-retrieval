## System Architecture (Conceptual)

The system follows a simple and scalable flow:

Case Context  
→ Context Extraction  
→ Policy Knowledge Index (pre-processed offline)  
→ Relevant Clause Retrieval  
→ Appian UI Panel

Offline document processing ensures fast runtime performance and scalability across large document collections.
