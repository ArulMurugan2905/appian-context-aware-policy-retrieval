## Appian UI Integration (Concept)

The retrieved policy clauses are displayed in a side panel within the Appian case view.

The interface allows agents to:
- View the policy document name
- Jump directly to page and paragraph
- Read exact clause text

All actions occur within the same Appian workflow, without context switching.
